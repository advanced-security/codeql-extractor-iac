## Getting Started

### Build the extractor

To build the extractor, use the following command:

```sh
./scripts/create-extractor-pack.sh
```

This will create the extractor pack in the `./extractor-pack` directory.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies of the queries, run the following command:

```sh
codeql pack install ./ql/lib
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the library queries.
Alternatively, you can install them using VSCode's CodeQL extension.

### Compiling the Library

To compile the library queries, run:

```sh
codeql pack create ./ql/lib
```

You can also install these packs into the CodeQL home directory using:

```sh
codeql pack install --output=$HOME/.codeql/packages ./ql/lib
```

This will allow your to use the library on your local machine with CodeQL CLI.

### Run Tests

To run all tests:

```sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Or use VSCode's test runner for supported tests.
